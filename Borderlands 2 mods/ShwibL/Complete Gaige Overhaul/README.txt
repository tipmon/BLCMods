This is a mod that completely alters all 3 of gaiges skill trees I made for fun.
Allmost every skill has been tweaked to reworked with entirely new ones added in.
It also comes with a decent amount of tweaks to DT and in addition movement and self damage changes to my own preferance with some other source qol mods that are credited and seperated in the file.
Command Extensions is required to make this mod functional.

This mod partly works in coop with 2 gaige using it, however it is a little buggy (look under coop section of the notes file) mainly any entirely new skills do not work for client. 
Coop with only one gaige I assume is fine as long as the gaige is the host however it is currently untested.
Have both players execute the file and join eachother on the main menu before proceeding.
Make sure to create a character if playing from a new save with this mod before applying it or it will crash.

This is my first ever modding project or anything project like this ever.
Take note that the left tree requires more points then typical and the right tree requires less then typical while the middle trees points to reach the capstone are unchanged.
Any and all feedback is appreciated!
